The FlipperZero is able to simulate a keyboard via USB connection.
Scripts can then be executed with which you can do all sorts of things.
Notice that I am not responsible for any damage caused, this project is just for fun.

## Installation

Windows:

```sh
1. Download the latest Release.
2. Extract the files.
3. Use the qFlipper app to drag the files into the "BadUsb" folder on your Flipper.
```

## Usage example

First, you can try out a few scripts on your own PC.
Most scripts are relatively harmless, but you should first read the description in the respective file.
Some scripts can also cause damage. Therefore, I am **NOT** responsible for any damage you cause.
